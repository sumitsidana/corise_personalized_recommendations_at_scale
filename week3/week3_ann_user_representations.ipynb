    "Often we are interested in finding nearest neighbors in a large space of vectors. To store embeddings for 400 million users and over 100 million items and querying them in real time is a challenging task. This is where approximate nearest neighbor approaches step in to help. Annoy, Faiss, ScaNN are typical libraries that are used for efficient vector similarity search at scale. They implement algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM.\n",

We will implement a vanilla search function to fetch the top-k nearest neighbors and estimate the time it takes for us to do so. We will then compare this with FAISS -- Facebook's nearest neighbour search library, and compare the time it takes for us to get nearest neighbours from FAISS versus our own implementation."
